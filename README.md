# Personal Site | jzxhuang
My personal site. Work in progress. Currently hosted using GitHub pages at http://jzxhuang.com.

Built by myself using [Bootstrap 4 (v4.0.0-alpha.6)](https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/), customized using select elements from [Material Design Lite for Bootstrap](https://mdbootstrap.com/) and the [Ekko-Lightbox plugin](http://ashleydw.github.io/lightbox/).
